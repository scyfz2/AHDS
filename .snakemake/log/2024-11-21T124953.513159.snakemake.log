MissingOutputException in rule clean_titles in file /home/fan/Applied_HD/AHDS_summative/Snakefile, line 65:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
logs/clean_titles.log (missing locally, parent dir contents: process_articles.log, process_titles.log, fetch_data.log)
Removing output files of failed job clean_titles since they might be corrupted:
data/processed/cleaned_articles.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
